## ⚡ Optimized Build System

### Quick Start

```bash
# Fast development build (~2 seconds)
npm run build:fast

# Development mode with hot reload  
npm run dev

# Individual app development
npm run dev --workspace=apps/astro
npm run dev --workspace=apps/healwave
```

### Build Commands

| Command | Purpose | Speed | Use Case |
|---------|---------|-------|----------|
| `npm run build:fast` | **Recommended** - Fast app builds | ~2s | Development, CI/CD |
| `npm run build:apps` | App builds only | ~2s | Application deployment |
| `npm run build:packages` | Package builds only | ~1.5s | Library distribution |
| `npm run build` | Legacy full build | ~2s | Backward compatibility |

### Performance Enhancements (August 2025)

- **83% faster builds** (20s → 2s)
- **Advanced code splitting** - Route & component-level chunking
- **Dynamic asset generation** - PWA icons with WebP optimization
- **Project structure cleanup** - Removed 12+ unnecessary files
- **Enhanced automation** - Log rotation and asset optimization scripts
- **Log rotation automation** - Production-ready log management
- **Bundle size optimization** - 60-80% reduction through strategic splitting

### Recent Structure Optimizations

- **Cleaned project structure** - Removed 12+ redundant files
- **Centralized testing** - Organized tests in `/tests/` directory
- **Enhanced automation** - Improved PWA icon generation and log rotation
- **Better documentation** - Consolidated development phase archives

See `BUILD_OPTIMIZATION.md` and `CLEANUP_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` for detailed information.

## 🛠️ Development

Use the Makefile for common tasks:

- `make test` — run all tests
- `make lint` — run all linters
- `make build` — build all frontends
- `make format` — format frontend code

### 🔧 New Development Tools (2025)

#### Asset Generation

- `./scripts/generate-pwa-icons.sh` — Generate optimized PWA icons with WebP support
- Supports SVG minification and PNG fallbacks

#### Log Management  

- `./scripts/rotate-logs.sh` — Automated log rotation with compression
- Prevents disk space issues in production

#### Testing Structure

- Centralized tests in `/tests/` directory
- Integration tests in `/tests/integration/`
- Organized by app: `tests/{astro,healwave,backend}/`

### 📊 Performance Targets (Updated 2025)

- **Build Time**: Sub-2 second builds with TurboRepo
- **Bundle Size**: <500KB initial load (after code splitting)
- **Time to Interactive**: <2 seconds on 3G networks
- **Core Web Vitals**: All metrics in green zone
- **PWA Score**: 95+ on Lighthouse audits

## Environment Variables

Environment strategy: strict separation of public (VITE_*) and server-only variables.
Docs: `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`

Validation commands:

- `npm run validate-env` (rules & leakage)
- `npm run validate-env-schema` (JSON schema enforcement)

### 🔐 Security & Production

#### Firestore Security

- Comprehensive security rules with user data validation
- Rate limiting protection (60 requests/minute per user)
- Role-based access control for premium content

#### Operational Log Management

- Automated log rotation to prevent disk space issues  
- Compressed archive storage for historical data
- Production-ready logging with structured output

#### Asset Optimization

- Dynamic PWA icon generation with WebP compression
- SVG minification for optimal loading performance
- Automated optimization pipeline for production builds
