# Layered AI Interpretation Roadmap (Merged Spec)

Status: Draft Spec (merged Grok + internal operational enrichment)
Scope: Evolution of interpretation engine across three maturity layers: Baseline Templated → Adaptive Contextual → Advanced Reinforcement.

## 1. Layer Comparison Table

| Layer | Description | Key Capabilities (Merged) | Required Data Signals (Progressive) | Evaluation Metrics (Engagement / Quality / Retention Lift Target) | Principal Risks | Guardrails & Mitigations |
|-------|-------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| 1. Baseline Templated | Deterministic slot + narrative templates with safe factual scope | Static chart templates; multi-system chart rendering (Western & Vedic initial); birth-data personalization; glossary & tone variants; safe fallback responses | Birth data (date/time/location); ephemeris (Swiss Ephemeris); static rules; basic profile (experience level); minimal feedback (thumbs) | Panel open-through rate / Template rubric score / +2–3% 7d retention vs control | Generic/stale tone; template leakage; false authority | Versioned template registry; factual scope limiter; placeholder coverage tests; rate limiting; disclaimers; daily lint scan |
| 2. Adaptive Contextual | Dynamically tailors emphasis & phrasing using contextual interactions & recent transits | Micro-personalization weighting; contextual transit weaving; variant generation & ranking; uncertainty annotations; phrasing diversity; extended modality adapters (numerology, human design, gene keys) for synthesis; cross-system narrative blending | Layer 1 + user interaction history; preference vectors; recent transits (time-scoped); cohort aggregate norms; semantic embeddings; structured feedback with sentiment | Re-open & dwell time / Weighted clarity+relevance+personalization rubric / +5–7% 30d retention vs Layer 1 | Privacy creep; bias amplification; overfitting to sparse history; hallucinated causal claims | Differential privacy noise; bias slice dashboard; personalization weight caps; explanation traces; opt-out toggle; anonymization/pseudonymization utils |
| 3. Advanced Reinforcement | Policy optimization & continuous improvement via reward modeling + bandits | Reward model scoring; multi-arm bandit or contextual policy selection; predictive trend surfacing & behavioral recommendations; self-evaluation scoring; drift/anomaly detection; longitudinal thematic coherence; cross-system synthesis narrative weaver | Layer 2 + structured labeled feedback; delayed retention cohort signals; reward labels; arm performance logs; model lineage metadata; aggregated anonymized engagement vectors | Policy arm win-rate & completion of recommended actions / Composite (coherence+factuality+user rating+agreement) / +8–12% 90d retention vs Layer 2 | Reward hacking; engagement over-optimization; feedback gaming; misalignment; model drift | Reward shaping audits; exploration caps; safety classifier ensemble; automatic rollback triggers; drift & reward calibration dashboards; red-team probes; human oversight loop |

## 2. Progressive Data Minimization & Classification

| Data Category | Layer 1 | Layer 2 | Layer 3 | Notes |
|---------------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| Birth Data (PII) | Required (hashed at rest) | Same | Same | Never exported to training corpora directly |
| Interaction Events (click/open) | Aggregated counts | Event-level (pseudonymized) | Event-level + temporal patterns | DP budget enforced from L2+ |
| Feedback (thumbs, rating) | Binary | Structured sentiment + rubric dims | Structured + reward labels | Label quality sampling pipeline |
| Preferences / Persona | Basic level flag | Vectorized preference embedding | Evolving representation | Embedding rotation & re-salt |
| Cohort Aggregates | N/A | Aggregated norms | Aggregated norms + drift baselines | k-anonymity thresholds |
| Retention Cohorts | N/A | 30d aggregated | 30/60/90d aggregated | Delayed (privacy-safe) ingestion |

## 3. Phase Entry & Exit Criteria

| Layer | Entry Preconditions | Exit (Promotion) Criteria |
|-------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| 1 → 2 | Template KPIs stable 30d; ≥60% positive feedback; P95 latency <400ms | Meet retention lift ≥2% & quality baseline; zero Sev1 incidents 30d |
| 2 → 3 | Personalization uplift statistically significant; guardrails audited; privacy review passed | Reward model Brier <0.18; retention lift ≥5% vs L1; no increase in negative feedback |
| Sustain 3 | Stable drift metrics; safety incident rate ≤ baseline | Retention lift ≥8% vs L2 sustained 60d; no reward hacking indicators |

## 4. Guardrail Matrix (Expanded)

| Dimension | Layer 1 | Layer 2 | Layer 3 |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Privacy | Min data capture | Differential privacy noise + opt-out | Aggregated + delayed ingestion; formal privacy budget |
| Bias | Manual template review | Slice-based bias dashboards | Continuous bias regression tests |
| Safety Claims | Hard-coded scope filter | Classifier + rule overlay | Ensemble safety + rollback trigger |
| Personalization Weight | Fixed rules | Capped weighting | Dynamic with upper bound + monitoring |
| Drift | N/A | Embedding distribution checks | Full policy/output drift detectors |
| Feedback Integrity | Simple thumbs dedupe | Anomaly detection on feedback bursts | Quality scoring + adversarial filtering |

## 5. Implementation Sequencing (High-Level)

1. Layer 1 (Weeks 0–4): Template authoring tool, registry, lint & slot tests, baseline metrics instrumentation.
2. Layer 2 (Weeks 5–12): Embedding generation pipeline, personalization service, variant ranker (heuristic → ML), bias & privacy frameworks, unified context assembler.
3. Layer 3 (Weeks 13–24+): Reward schema design, offline replay evaluator, bandit orchestrator, safety ensemble, drift monitors, gradual arm rollout.

## 6. Observability & MLOps Hooks

| Hook | Layer 1 | Layer 2 | Layer 3 |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| Metrics | Render latency, open rate, feedback ratio | +Personalization delta, bias slices | +Reward gain, arm win-rate, drift scores |
| Tracing | Template ID + version | +Context feature vector hash | +Policy ID, reward attribution chain |
| Logging | Basic structured logs | +Feature extraction summaries | +Reward model inputs/outputs (sampled) |

## 8. Next Actions

1. Approve merged spec & link from prompt index.
2. Derive implementation tickets (Layer 1) for: template registry, lint harness, metrics baseline.
3. Define privacy baseline doc referencing data minimization table.
4. Draft reward schema outline (placeholder) for early Layer 3 prep.
