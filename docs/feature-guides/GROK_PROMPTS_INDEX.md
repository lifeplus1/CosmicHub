## Active Inline Prompts (Copy/Paste)

<!-- EXP-002 prompt removed after completion; see data file for canonical variants. -->

<!-- Historical completed prompts removed per cleanup directive. References retained in table above. -->

## Usage Guidelines

1. Run creative/ideation prompts in **Grok** first for breadth, then refine implementation details with Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
2. Request JSON where structured ingestion or A/B testing pipelines are anticipated.
3. Keep a local copy of raw Grok responses under `docs/feature-guides/grok-responses/YYYY-MM-DD/` (not yet automated).
4. After acceptance, distill stable specifications into implementation summary docs.
