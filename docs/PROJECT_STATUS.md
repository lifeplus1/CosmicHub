# Project Progress Summary

## Phase 1 Completion: TypeScript Foundation

We have successfully completed Phase 1 of the linting improvement plan. This phase focused on
establishing a stable TypeScript build foundation across the monorepo, especially for cross-package
dependencies.

### Key Accomplishments

- Fixed TypeScript module resolution between `@cosmichub/config` and `@cosmichub/ui`
- Corrected build configurations to emit both JavaScript and declaration files
- Implemented proper subpath exports with type declarations
- Resolved Firebase dynamic import pattern issues
- Created build workflows that enable progress to Phase 2

### Implementation Details

The implementation required addressing several complex TypeScript configuration challenges:

1. **Config Package**:
   - Created dedicated runtime build configuration that properly emits JS
   - Enhanced declaration file copying script to include hooks directory
   - Structured package exports with proper `types` and `default` fields

2. **UI Package**:
   - Updated path mappings to reference compiled outputs
   - Fixed dynamic imports for Firebase analytics modules
   - Implemented temporary build script with relaxed type checking

### Current Build Process

The monorepo can now be built with:

```bash
# Build config package
pnpm --filter @cosmichub/config build

# Build UI package (temporary workaround for Phase 1)
pnpm --filter @cosmichub/ui build:phase1
```

## Concurrency Model Specification

We've also defined optimal instance configuration for both development and CI/CD environments:

### Development Environment

- **TypeScript Transpilation**: 2 instances, `ts-worker-v2` model, 4GB memory per instance
- **ESLint Processing**: 2 instances, `lint-agent-v1` model, optimized for rule application
- **Test Runner**: 3 instances, `test-runner-v3` model, with coverage analysis
- **Frontend Dev Server**: 1 instance, `vite-hmr-v2` model, for HMR and serving
- **Backend API Server**: 1 instance, `python-fastapi-v1` model

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **Build Agent**: 4 instances, `build-agent-v2` model, for parallel package building
- **Test Matrix**: 6 instances, `test-matrix-v1` model, for browser/device testing
- **Lint & Type Check**: 3 instances, `lint-type-v2` model, for validation
- **Bundle Analysis**: 1 instance, `bundle-analyzer-v1` model
- **Deployment Preparation**: 1 instance, `deploy-prep-v1` model

The full concurrency model specification includes detailed resource scaling logic, implementation
guidelines, resource management recommendations, and monitoring strategies.

## Next Steps: Phase 2

For Phase 2, we will focus on:

1. **Declaration File Resolution**: Fix remaining TS7016 errors for subpath modules
2. **Firebase Module Type Resolution**: Resolve typing issues with Firebase analytics
3. **ESLint Rule Tightening**: Begin implementing stricter linting rules
4. **Automation**: Add validation for exports and declaration files
5. **Workaround Removal**: Eliminate temporary build scripts and configs
