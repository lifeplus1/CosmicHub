# Linting Improvement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive approach to resolve remaining errors and implement stricter linting rules across the CosmicHub codebase. The plan is structured in phases to efficiently address foundational issues before enabling more stringent rules.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Fixes

**Agent Model**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
**Focus**: Resolve TypeScript path resolution and package cross-dependencies

- Fix TypeScript configuration issues in packages/ui/tsconfig.json and related files
- Resolve path resolution errors (TS6305/TS6307)
- Address cross-package dependencies between UI and config packages
- Ensure consistent build output paths across packages

## Phase 2: Core Rule Tightening
**Concurrent Instances**: 3

### Instance 1: Runtime Safety Rules
**Agent Model**: GPT-4o
**Focus**: 
- Enable and fix errors for rules preventing runtime exceptions
- Implement null checking, undefined access prevention
- Fix potential type coercion issues

### Instance 2: Type Safety Rules
**Agent Model**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
**Focus**:
- Strengthen TypeScript strictness settings
- Fix interface compliance issues
- Address missing type annotations
- Resolve any-type usage

### Instance 3: Code Quality Rules
**Agent Model**: GPT-4o-mini
**Focus**:
- Implement consistent coding patterns
- Fix formatting inconsistencies
- Address naming convention violations
- Clean up unused imports and variables

## Phase 3: Advanced Rules
**Concurrent Instances**: 2

### Instance 1: Accessibility & React Rules
**Agent Model**: GPT-4o
**Focus**:
- Implement a11y best practices
- Fix React-specific lint issues
- Address component lifecycle problems
- Ensure proper hook usage

### Instance 2: Performance & Best Practices
**Agent Model**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
**Focus**:
- Optimize performance-critical code paths
- Implement security best practices
- Address potential memory leaks
- Fix browser compatibility issues

## Execution Plan
1. Complete Phase 1 before proceeding to ensure solid foundation
2. Run Phase 2 instances concurrently after Phase 1 completion
3. Run Phase 3 instances concurrently after Phase 2 completion
4. Validate each phase with comprehensive test and build verification

## Success Metrics
- 0 TypeScript errors
- All enabled lint rules passing
- No disabled rules without explicit justification
- Successful builds across all packages and applications
- Comprehensive documentation of enabled rules and exceptions
