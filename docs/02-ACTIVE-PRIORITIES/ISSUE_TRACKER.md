### **REL-012: Firebase Auth Dependency Timeout Investigation**

- **Issue ID:** REL-012
- **Priority:** 🟢 LOW
- **Category:** System Reliability/Testing
- **Status:** 📋 TODO
- **Effort:** 4-6 hours
- **Assignee:** TBD
- **Due Date:** Sprint Buffer/Maintenance Window

**Description:** Investigate and resolve timeout issue in test environment when Firebase auth
dependency is injected during HTTP request processing.

**Background:**

During test execution of `test_chart_save_and_interpretation_flow`, the system hangs for 10+ seconds
during HTTP POST request to `/api/charts/save`. Investigation revealed:

- ✅ **Redis hanging issue completely resolved** via REL-010 circuit breaker implementation
- ✅ App startup and module initialization work perfectly
- ✅ TestClient creation succeeds without issues
- ❌ **Hang occurs during HTTP request dependency injection**, specifically in
  `verify_id_token_dependency`

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The hang appears to be in the Firebase auth verification process (`auth.verify_id_token(token_str)`)
during test execution, likely due to:

- Mock Firebase auth configuration timing out
- Network calls to Firebase Auth servers in test environment
- Synchronous blocking calls in async context

**Requirements:**

- Identify exact location of timeout in Firebase auth dependency chain
- Implement proper timeout handling for Firebase auth calls
- Add circuit breaker protection to Firebase auth operations
- Ensure test environment uses proper auth mocking without network calls
- Validate fix doesn't impact production auth performance

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Test execution completes within 5 seconds (down from 10+ second timeout)
- [ ] Firebase auth dependency injection has proper timeout handling
- [ ] Circuit breaker protection added to auth operations
- [ ] Test environment properly mocks Firebase auth without network calls
- [ ] Production auth performance remains unaffected
- [ ] Integration with existing REL-010/011 monitoring

**Technical Context:**

```bash
# Current behavior:
=== Simple Debug Test ===
✓ App starts successfully
✓ TestClient created
🔍 About to make POST request...
❌ Request timed out after 10 seconds  # <- Issue here
```

**Files to Investigate:**

- `backend/api/charts.py` - `verify_id_token_dependency` function
- `backend/auth.py` - Firebase auth initialization and token verification
- `backend/test_simple_debug.py` - Test configuration and environment setup
- Firebase mock auth configuration in test environment

**Success Metrics:**

- Test execution time: <5 seconds (target: 2-3 seconds)
- Firebase auth call timeout: <2 seconds with circuit breaker
- Zero production impact on auth performance
- Enhanced test reliability and developer experience
