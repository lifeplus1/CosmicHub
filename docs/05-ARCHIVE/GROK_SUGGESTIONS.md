# InterpretationForm.tsx

To optimize performance and align with project standards:

Memoization: Wrap the component in React.memo if it's re-rendered frequently, e.g., export default
React.memo(InterpretationForm); to reduce render cycles.

Lazy Loading: If this form is part of a larger page, consider lazy-loading it via React.lazy in the
parent component for faster initial loads.

Efficient Queries: The API calls (e.g., generateAIInterpretation) should use batched Firestore reads
if fetching related data; add Redis caching for repeated interpretations to scale for high loads.

Modularity: Extract focus area toggles into a shared component in packages/ui to avoid duplication
and promote reuse across apps.

Security: Use environment variables for API endpoints; implement rate limiting on generation to
prevent abuse.

Marketability: Add tooltips for premium features (e.g., advanced interpretations tied to Stripe
subscriptions).

Robustness: Add Vitest tests for form states and error handling; integrate error boundaries.
