"memory_delta_mb": 0.02, "calculations_per_sec": 1356.94, "num_calculations": 1, "success": true}

Calculation successful: shape (3, 3)
Metrics collected: ['monitoring_enabled', 'performance', 'cache']
Second calculation (cached): shape (3, 3)
Cache hits: 1, Hit rate: 50.0%
Phase 3 integration working successfully!
```

## Integration into Main Application

### For Existing API Endpoints

1. **Update synastry router**:

```python
from utils.optimized_vectorized_integration import optimized_synastry_calculation

# In synastry endpoint:
result = optimized_synastry_calculation(chart1, chart2, orb=orb, use_caching=True)
return result
```

1. **Add batch processing endpoints**:

```python
from utils.optimized_vectorized_integration import OptimizedVectorizedAspectCalculator

calculator = OptimizedVectorizedAspectCalculator()
results = calculator.calculate_large_batch_synastry(chart_pairs, progress_callback=callback)
```

### Configuration Options
