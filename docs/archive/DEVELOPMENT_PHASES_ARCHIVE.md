## üèÜ Key Learnings & Best Practices

### Performance Optimization

1. **Lazy Loading**: Critical for large applications with multiple features
2. **Code Splitting**: Route-based splitting provides the best balance
3. **Bundle Analysis**: Regular monitoring prevents performance regression
4. **Caching Strategies**: Proper cache invalidation is crucial

### Development Workflow

1. **TypeScript**: Strict typing prevents runtime errors
2. **Testing**: Integration tests catch more issues than unit tests alone
3. **Documentation**: Living documentation prevents knowledge silos
4. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful degradation improves user experience

### Deployment & Operations
