# Historical Lint Documentation Archive

**Archive Date**: August 21, 2025  
**Reason**: Significant improvement in lint status made these documents obsolete

## Archive Summary

This folder contains historical lint documentation that was created when the project had significant
linting issues (953+ errors baseline). Since the project achieved excellent lint status (3 errors -
99.7% improvement), these documents are no longer current but are preserved for historical
reference.

## Current Status (August 21, 2025)

- **TypeScript**: ‚úÖ 0 errors (perfect)
- **ESLint**: ‚ö†Ô∏è 3 errors, 10 warnings (production ready)
- **Overall**: üéâ 99.7% improvement from baseline
- **Status**: Production ready
