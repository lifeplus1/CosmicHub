## 🎯 **AI ASSISTANT GUIDANCE**

### **When Working on This Project:**

1. **Check Current Status First**: Always reference `LINT_SUMMARY.md` for current error state
2. **Follow Architecture**: Use existing patterns in `packages/` for shared code
3. **Maintain Quality**: No TypeScript errors, ESLint violations, or failing tests
4. **Update Documentation**: Keep relevant docs updated with changes
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Run `pnpm run test` and `pnpm run build` before suggesting completion

### **Key Commands**

```bash
# Build and test everything
pnpm run build
pnpm run test
pnpm run lint

# Start development servers
pnpm run dev-frontend  # Both Astro and HealWave
pnpm run dev-backend   # Python FastAPI server

# Type checking
pnpm run type-check
```

### **Important Constraints**

- **No breaking changes** to existing APIs without discussion
- **Maintain backward compatibility** for user data
- **Follow existing patterns** for consistency
- **Test coverage must remain >95%**
- **All code must pass ESLint and TypeScript compilation**
