## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Calculation Accuracy

- Uses Swiss Ephemeris for precise astronomical calculations
- Implements correct I Ching gate mapping (360Â° Ã· 64 gates)
- Handles both conscious (birth time) and unconscious (design time ~88 days prior) calculations
- Proper timezone and location handling

### Data Structures

- Comprehensive response models with TypeScript interfaces
- Structured JSON responses for easy frontend consumption
- Error handling with detailed user-friendly messages
- Validation for all input parameters

### User Experience

- Progressive disclosure with tabbed interfaces
- Interactive elements for exploration
- Educational content integrated throughout
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Loading states and error handling
- Beautiful visual design with consistent theming

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Validation

### API Testing

- Created comprehensive test script (`/test_endpoints.py`)
- All 4 endpoints tested and passing:

  âœ… Human Design calculation
  âœ… Gene Keys calculation  
  âœ… Gene Key details
  âœ… Daily contemplation
