## Technical Implementation

The mock login system works by:

1. **Authentication**: Uses Firebase Auth with predefined email/password combinations
2. **Tier Recognition**: The `SubscriptionContext` checks the user's email address and assigns the
   appropriate tier
3. **Feature Access**: The `FeatureGuard` component and `useSubscription` hook control access to
   features based on the user's tier
4. **Usage Simulation**: Mock usage data is provided to test limits and quotas

## Development Notes

- Mock users are created automatically on first login attempt
- The system falls back to creating accounts if they don't exist
- All mock accounts have active subscriptions with 30-day periods
- Usage data is simulated and doesn't persist between sessions

## Environment

This mock system only works in development environments and should not be deployed to production.
