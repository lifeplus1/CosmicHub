This outline expands on the draft stub for the experiment lifecycle in the context of the astrology
app (e.g., for A/B testing features like AI interpretations, chart displays, or premium prompts). It
defines phases, entry/exit criteria, overlap rules, and archive requirements. The lifecycle ensures
experiments are scalable, secure, and performant, aligning with Firestore indexing for data
tracking, Redis caching for real-time monitoring, and comprehensive testing via Vitest/pytest.
Phases are sequential by default but allow controlled overlaps for efficiency.

## Phases Overview

The lifecycle consists of five phases: **Design** → **Launch** → **Monitor** → **Stop** →
**Archive**. Each phase includes modular checkpoints to enforce type safety (e.g., TypeScript
schemas for experiment configs) and accessibility (e.g., WCAG-compliant logging interfaces).

### 1. Design Phase

- **Description**: Define experiment goals, hypotheses, variants (e.g., A/B for numerology UI),
  metrics (e.g., user engagement via Firebase Analytics), and resources. Use modular configs in
  TurboRepo-shared packages for consistency across apps like `astro` and `healwave`.
- **Entry Criteria**:
  - Approved experiment proposal (e.g., via Jira ticket or GitHub issue).
  - Stakeholder alignment (e.g., product, engineering, data teams).
  - Baseline data available (e.g., current user trends from Firestore queries).
- **Exit Criteria**:
  - Complete experiment plan document (e.g., in `docs/experiments/` with TypeScript-typed configs).
  - Risk assessment passed (e.g., security review for data handling, performance impact simulation
    via Vite bundle analysis).
  - Test coverage ≥80% for related code (verified via Vitest).
- **Duration Estimate**: 1-4 weeks, depending on complexity.

### 2. Launch Phase

- **Description**: Implement, test, and deploy the experiment. Integrate with backend (FastAPI
  endpoints) and frontend (React components with lazy loading). Use feature flags (e.g., via
  Firebase Remote Config) for controlled rollout.
- **Entry Criteria**:
  - Design phase exited successfully.
  - Code reviewed and merged (e.g., PR approved with ESLint checks).
  - Staging environment validated (e.g., Docker Compose local tests).
- **Exit Criteria**:
  - Successful deployment to production (e.g., via Vercel/Netlify, with zero-downtime rollout).
  - Initial health checks passed (e.g., <5% error rate in first hour, monitored via Sentry).
  - Target audience exposed (e.g., 10-50% user split via Firebase A/B testing).
- **Duration Estimate**: 1-2 weeks.

### 3. Monitor Phase

- **Description**: Track metrics in real-time (e.g., conversion rates for premium subscriptions).
  Use caching (Redis) for efficient data fetches and batched Firestore reads to handle large
  datasets. Include AI-driven anomaly detection if applicable.
- **Entry Criteria**:
  - Launch phase exited.
  - Monitoring dashboards set up (e.g., Firebase Console or custom EphemerisPerformanceDashboard).
  - Baseline metrics established.
- **Exit Criteria**:
  - Predefined duration reached (e.g., 2-8 weeks) or statistical significance achieved (e.g.,
    p-value <0.05 via scipy in backend).
  - No critical issues (e.g., performance degradation >10% in render cycles).
  - Decision made (e.g., winner variant identified).
- **Duration Estimate**: Variable (2-12 weeks), based on sample size needs.

### 4. Stop Phase

- **Description**: Ramp down the experiment, clean up resources (e.g., remove feature flags), and
  finalize data collection. Ensure modularity by isolating cleanup scripts in `scripts/` (e.g.,
  `cleanup-experiment.sh`).
- **Entry Criteria**:
  - Monitor phase exited.
  - All data collected and validated (e.g., no pending Firestore writes).
- **Exit Criteria**:
  - Experiment fully deactivated (e.g., 100% traffic to winner or control).
  - Resources freed (e.g., delete temporary Firestore collections, clear Redis caches).
  - Post-mortem report drafted (e.g., lessons learned on scalability).
- **Duration Estimate**: 1-3 days.

### 5. Archive Phase

- **Description**: Store results for future reference, ensuring compliance and auditability. Align
  with security standards (e.g., anonymize user data via Pydantic models).
- **Entry Criteria**:
  - Stop phase exited.
  - Final report approved.
- **Exit Criteria**:
  - All artifacts archived (see requirements below).
  - Knowledge transfer complete (e.g., update `docs/archive/`).
  - No open issues.
- **Duration Estimate**: 1-2 days.

## Overlap Rules

To optimize performance and reduce build times (e.g., via TurboRepo caching), controlled overlaps
are allowed:

- **Design ↔ Launch**: Up to 20% overlap (e.g., prototype coding during late design) if low-risk
  and approved.
- **Launch ↔ Monitor**: Automatic overlap during rollout (e.g., monitoring starts at 1% exposure);
  full overlap prohibited to avoid untested data pollution.
- **Monitor ↔ Stop**: Up to 50% overlap for gradual ramp-down (e.g., stop while final metrics
  trickle in), but only if metrics are stable.
- **Stop ↔ Archive**: Full overlap encouraged for efficiency (e.g., archive during cleanup).
- **General Rules**: No overlaps across non-adjacent phases. Use rate limiting (e.g., in FastAPI) to
  prevent overload. Document overlaps in experiment logs for traceability.

## Archive Requirements

Archiving ensures robustness and marketability (e.g., reusable insights for cross-promotions). Store
in a dedicated `docs/archive/experiments/` folder or Firestore collection for scalability.

- **What to Archive**:
  - Experiment plan, code diffs, and configs (TypeScript/Pydantic schemas).
  - Raw and aggregated data (anonymized; e.g., CSV exports from Firestore).
  - Metrics reports (e.g., JSON with performance stats like query times).
  - Post-mortem analysis (Markdown with key findings, e.g., "AI chat improved engagement by 15%").
  - Screenshots/videos of variants (for UI experiments).
- **How to Archive**:
  - Use version control (Git tags like `experiment-xyz-archive`).
  - Compress large files (e.g., via scripts in `scripts/`).
  - Retention: Permanent for core experiments; 1 year for minor ones.
  - Access: Restricted via Firestore rules; audit logs enabled.
- **Performance Considerations**: Batch uploads to avoid high loads; use lazy loading in any archive
  viewer components.

This outline can be implemented as a shared utility in the monorepo (e.g.,
`packages/experiments/lifecycle.ts`) for enforcement across features. Suggest refining with specific
metrics thresholds in future iterations.
