# Phase 1 Progress Report: Infrastructure Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **TypeScript Path Resolution Errors**
   - TS6059: Files not under 'rootDir'
   - TS6307: Files not listed within file list
   - These errors occur due to cross-package dependencies between UI and config packages

2. **Firebase Import Issues**
   - Module errors in firebase modules
   - Missing exported members from firebase packages

3. **Build Process Issues**
   - Circular dependencies between packages
   - Incorrect output path configurations

## Solutions Implemented

1. **TypeScript Configuration Updates**
   - Added proper rootDir setting to packages/ui/tsconfig.json
   - Added explicit path mappings for cross-package imports
   - Updated project references to ensure proper build order

2. **Package Dependency Management**
   - Added explicit dependency from UI package to config package
   - Configured workspace dependency with "workspace:*" in package.json

3. **Build Process Improvements**
   - Created build scripts to ensure correct build order
   - Implemented workaround to bypass path resolution errors temporarily

## Current Status

The infrastructure fixes are partially complete. We've implemented a workaround that allows the build to proceed despite the TypeScript errors by:

1. Building the config package first
2. Building the UI package with type checking disabled
3. Running separate type checks to identify remaining issues

This approach allows development to continue while we address the underlying structural issues.

## Remaining Tasks for Phase 1

1. **Complete Path Resolution Fix**
   - Fix the cross-package dependencies by properly configuring module boundaries
   - Ensure each package correctly exports its public API

2. **Fix Firebase Integration**
   - Update firebase imports to match the available exports
   - Add proper type declarations for firebase modules

3. **Fix Build Configuration**
   - Update tsconfig files to correctly handle cross-package references
   - Ensure proper declaration file generation for package exports

## Next Steps

1. Complete Phase 1 by resolving the remaining infrastructure issues
2. Move to Phase 2 to begin tightening linting rules
3. Update build and CI scripts to enforce stricter checks
