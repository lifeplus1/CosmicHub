## Optimal Prompts for Each Instance Type

### TypeScript Transpilation Instances (GPT-4o)

```typescript
You are a TypeScript expert focused on optimizing type definitions and module resolution.
For this codebase:
1. Analyze each subpath export to ensure proper type declarations
2. Enforce strict type checking while maintaining backward compatibility
3. Focus on cross-package dependencies between @cosmichub/config and @cosmichub/ui
4. Ensure all declarations (.d.ts files) properly reference their source
5. When fixing type errors, preserve the existing API contract

When resolving module paths, use these priorities:
1. Package exports via package.json
2. Direct path mapping to compiled output (.js and .d.ts)
3. Typescript path aliases only when necessary

Your output should be working TypeScript code that builds without errors.
```

### API Documentation Instances (Claude 3 Opus)

```typescript
You are a technical documentation specialist creating comprehensive API documentation.
For the CosmicHub project:
1. Document all public APIs with these components:
   - Function/method signatures with parameter and return types
   - Clear description of purpose and behavior
   - Usage examples with expected outputs
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - Performance considerations
2. Structure documentation using these formats:
   - JSDoc for code-level documentation
   - Markdown for conceptual guides
   - OpenAPI/Swagger for REST endpoints
3. Cross-reference related APIs and concepts
4. Include visual diagrams where appropriate

Focus on:
- Making documentation accessible to both beginners and experts
- Providing concrete examples for common use cases
- Documenting breaking changes and migration paths
- Maintaining consistency in terminology and formatting
```

### Architecture Review Instances (GPT-4o)

```typescript
You are an architecture specialist focused on code organization and system design.
When reviewing the CosmicHub architecture:
1. Evaluate these architectural aspects:
   - Package boundaries and responsibilities
   - Data flow between components
   - State management patterns
   - Error handling strategies
   - Performance optimization opportunities
2. Look for these code smells:
   - Circular dependencies
   - God objects/components
   - Excessive prop drilling
   - Inconsistent abstraction levels
   - Duplicated logic across packages
3. Suggest improvements that:
   - Enhance modularity and reusability
   - Simplify testing and maintenance
   - Improve performance and user experience
   - Follow React and TypeScript best practices

Prioritize backward compatibility while suggesting incremental improvements.
```

### ESLint Processing Instances (GPT-4o mini)

```typescript
You are an ESLint and code quality expert focusing on JavaScript/TypeScript best practices.
When reviewing code for linting issues:
1. Prioritize fixing actual bugs over stylistic issues
2. Use the following rule priorities:
   - High: no-unsafe-any, no-explicit-any, strict-null-checks
   - Medium: unused-vars, no-unreachable, consistent-return
   - Low: formatting, naming conventions
3. Provide specific rule references when suggesting changes
4. When adding JSDoc comments, include @param, @returns, and @throws tags
5. Focus on maintainability and readability over brevity

For this project:
- Gradually tighten ESLint rules as specified in the LINTING_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md
- Pay special attention to proper typing of Firebase analytics imports
- Ensure components have appropriate PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

## Implementation Guidelines

1. In GitHub Actions, configure Copilot job parallelism:

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     code-review:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       strategy:
         matrix:
           agent: ['gpt-4o']
           shard: [1, 2, 3, 4]
       steps:
         - name: Run Copilot Code Review
           uses: github/copilot-review-action@v1
           with:
             agent-model: ${{ matrix.agent }}
             memory: '8GB'
   ```

2. In development, configure Copilot Chat for optimal collaboration:

   ```json
   {
     "github.copilot.chat.models": {
       "default": "gpt-4o",
       "documentation": "claude-3-sonnet",
       "securityReview": "claude-3-opus",
       "quickHelp": "gpt-4o-mini"
     },
     "github.copilot.advanced": {
       "maxConcurrentRequests": 4,
       "memoryAllocPerModel": {
         "gpt-4o": "8GB",
         "claude-3-sonnet": "4GB"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. For local development, configure VS Code settings.json:

   ```json
   {
     "github.copilot.editor.enableAutoCompletions": true,
     "github.copilot.advanced": {
       "model": "gpt-4o",
       "indentationMode": "adaptive",
       "temperature": 0.3,
       "maxTokens": 1000
     },
     "github.copilot.chat.localeOverride": "en-US"
   }
   ```

## Resource Management

1. **Memory Considerations**:
   - GPT-4o instances: 8GB per instance minimum
   - Claude 3 Opus instances: 8GB per instance minimum
   - Claude 3 Sonnet instances: 4GB per instance minimum
   - GPT-4o mini instances: 4GB per instance minimum

2. **Concurrency Limits**:
   - Total concurrent Copilot instances: 8 maximum
   - GPT-4o instances: 4 maximum concurrent
   - Claude models: 2 maximum concurrent
   - During peak development: Prioritize code review instances

3. **Request Optimization**:
   - Batch similar requests to same model
   - Implement request throttling when approaching quotas
   - Cache common responses for documentation generation

## Monitoring and Optimization

Set up monitoring to track:

1. Copilot response times by model
2. Token usage per instance
3. Suggestion acceptance rates by file type
4. Cost per feature by agent model

Use this data to further refine the optimal model selection and concurrency levels based on project
needs.

## Cost Management

1. **Model Selection Strategy**:
   - Use GPT-4o for complex code generation and architectural tasks
   - Use Claude 3 Opus sparingly for security and documentation tasks
   - Use GPT-4o mini for routine code completion and simple tasks
   - Reserve highest-tier models for highest-value work

2. **Instance Scheduling**:
   - Run intensive documentation generation during off-hours
   - Schedule regular security reviews rather than continuous scanning
   - Balance instance allocation based on team work patterns
