# Grok Integration Prompts for Priority Tasks

## ðŸ”¥ **UI-001: Synastry Analysis - Send to Grok**

### **Primary Prompt for Synastry Calculation Logic**

```text
I'm building a comprehensive synastry analysis system for a modern astrology app. I need you to provide detailed algorithms and formulas for analyzing relationship compatibility between two birth charts.

Please provide:

1. **PLANETARY ASPECT ANALYSIS**:
   - Formulas for calculating inter-chart aspects (conjunctions, oppositions, trines, squares, sextiles, quincunx)
   - Orb calculations for different aspect types (tight vs. wide orbs)
   - Aspect strength weighting system (0-10 scale)
   - Special considerations for Sun-Moon, Venus-Mars, and other romantic combinations

2. **HOUSE OVERLAY ANALYSIS**:
   - Methodology for analyzing Person A's planets in Person B's houses
   - Interpretation framework for each house overlay combination
   - Scoring system for house emphasis patterns
   - Most significant house overlays for relationships

3. **COMPATIBILITY SCORING ALGORITHM**:
   - Overall compatibility score calculation (0-100 scale)
   - Individual category scores: Emotional, Mental, Physical, Spiritual
   - Weighting factors for different planetary combinations
   - Bonus points for special configurations (composite aspects, etc.)

4. **INTERPRETATION TEMPLATES**:
   - Text templates for major aspect patterns
   - Relationship strength indicators and descriptions  
   - Challenge areas and growth opportunities
   - Compatibility summary frameworks

5. **ADVANCED FEATURES**:
   - Composite chart midpoint calculations
   - Davison relationship chart considerations
   - Progressed synastry analysis methods
   - Transit impacts on relationship timing

Focus on both traditional and modern astrological techniques. Provide mathematical formulas where applicable and ensure the system can handle edge cases like intercepted houses and retrograde planets.
```

### **Secondary Prompt for Implementation Details**

```text
Based on the synastry analysis system you provided, I need specific implementation guidance for a FastAPI backend with TypeScript frontend:

1. **DATA STRUCTURES**: 
   - JSON schema for synastry analysis requests
   - Response format for compatibility scores and interpretations
   - Database schema for caching synastry results

2. **CALCULATION WORKFLOW**:
   - Step-by-step process for analyzing two charts
   - Error handling for incomplete birth data
   - Performance optimization for complex calculations

3. **SCORING FORMULAS**:
   - Exact mathematical formulas in pseudocode
   - Normalization methods for 0-100 compatibility scale
   - Weighting coefficients for different aspect types

4. **INTERPRETATION LOGIC**:
   - Rule-based system for generating text interpretations
   - Conditional logic for special relationship patterns
   - Personalization based on chart dominants

Please provide concrete examples and edge case handling.

## ðŸŒŸ **UI-002: AI Interpretation Service - Send to Grok**

### **Primary Prompt for Interpretation Framework**

```text
I'm developing an AI-powered astrological interpretation system that provides personalized chart analysis. I need you to create comprehensive interpretation templates and content frameworks.

Please provide:

1. **INTERPRETATION ARCHITECTURE**:
   - Hierarchical structure for chart analysis (overview â†’ detailed â†’ synthesis)
   - Template system for different interpretation depths (quick, standard, comprehensive)
   - Personalization parameters based on user preferences
   - Content modularity for mixing/matching interpretation components

2. **PLANETARY INTERPRETATION TEMPLATES**:
   - Framework for Planet-in-Sign combinations (all 120 combinations)
   - Planet-in-House interpretation structures (all 144 combinations)  
   - Aspect interpretation templates with orb considerations
   - Retrograde planet interpretation modifications

3. **CHART PATTERN RECOGNITION**:
   - Major configuration identification (Grand Trine, T-Square, Yod, etc.)
   - Stellium analysis and interpretation frameworks
   - Chart shape analysis (Bundle, Locomotive, Splay, etc.)
   - Element/Quality/Polarity emphasis interpretation

4. **SYNTHESIS METHODOLOGY**:
   - Process for combining individual interpretations into cohesive reading
   - Priority weighting system for contradictory indications
   - Life theme identification from chart patterns
   - Personality archetype classification system

5. **CONTENT GENERATION TEMPLATES**:
   - Engaging opening statements for chart readings
   - Transitional phrases between interpretation sections
   - Summary and conclusion templates
   - Action-oriented advice formatting

6. **PROMPT ENGINEERING**:
   - Optimal prompts for feeding chart data to AI interpretation engines
   - Context templates that ensure consistent interpretation quality
   - Error handling prompts for unusual chart configurations
   - Quality control prompts for interpretation accuracy

Focus on creating interpretations that are:
- Psychologically insightful but accessible
- Personalized and specific rather than generic
- Balanced between positive and challenging aspects  
- Actionable with practical life guidance
- Engaging and well-written for modern audiences

Include both traditional astrological wisdom and contemporary psychological approaches.
```

### **Secondary Prompt for Technical Integration**

```text
Based on the interpretation framework you provided, I need technical specifications for integrating with XAI/Grok API and caching systems:

1. **API INTEGRATION PATTERNS**:
   - Optimal prompt structures for chart interpretation requests
   - Streaming response handling for long interpretations
   - Error recovery strategies for API failures
   - Rate limiting and cost optimization approaches

2. **CONTENT CACHING STRATEGY**:
   - Which interpretations to cache vs. generate fresh
   - Cache key generation for chart configurations
   - Cache invalidation rules for interpretation updates
   - Performance optimization for repeated requests

3. **QUALITY ASSURANCE**:
   - Validation rules for interpretation accuracy
   - Fallback content for API failures
   - A/B testing framework for interpretation variants
   - User feedback integration for continuous improvement

4. **PERSONALIZATION SYSTEM**:
   - User preference data structures
