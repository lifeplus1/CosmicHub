# Stripe Integration Testing & Verification Guide

## 🧪 How to Test the Stripe Integration

### Prerequisites

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Stripe test keys configured in `.env`
   - Backend running on `http://localhost:8000`
   - Frontend running on `http://localhost:5174`

2. **Test Stripe Keys**
   ```bash
   VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
   ```

### Testing Scenarios

#### 1. **Upgrade Modal Flow**

**Path:** Navigate to `/upgrade-demo`

**Test Steps:**
1. Click "Test Gene Keys Feature" (requires Pro)
2. Verify upgrade modal appears with contextual recommendations
3. Click "Upgrade to Pro" button
4. Should redirect to Stripe Checkout (or show error if keys not configured)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Modal shows with feature-specific messaging
- Tier recommendations are contextual
- Graceful fallback if Stripe not configured

#### 2. **Pricing Page Integration**

**Path:** Navigate to `/pricing` or click pricing link

**Test Steps:**
1. Toggle between Monthly/Annual billing
2. Click "Subscribe Now" on Premium or Elite tier
3. Should initiate Stripe Checkout session

**Expected Behavior:**
- Loading state during checkout creation
- Toast notification confirming redirect
- Annual discount calculation visible

#### 3. **Authentication Flow**

**Test Steps:**
1. Sign out of the application
2. Try to upgrade from any component
3. Should show authentication required message

**Expected Behavior:**
- No Stripe calls made without authentication
- Clear messaging about sign-in requirement
- Graceful error handling

#### 4. **Success/Cancel Pages**

**Test URLs:**
- Success: `http://localhost:5174/pricing/success?tier=premium&session_id=test123`
- Cancel: `http://localhost:5174/pricing/cancel?tier=premium&feature=Gene%20Keys`

**Expected Behavior:**
- Success page shows subscription confirmation
- Cancel page offers retry options
- Both pages have proper navigation

### Development Testing

#### 1. **Console Logging**

With proper Stripe keys, you should see:
```
🔥 Firebase initialized for project: astrology-app-9c2e9
✅ Environment (development) configured successfully
🎯 Stripe service initialized successfully
```

Without Stripe keys:
```
⚠️ Stripe public key not configured. Stripe functionality will be disabled.
⚠️ Stripe service not available: Stripe public key is required
```

#### 2. **Network Requests**

When triggering upgrades, check Network tab for:
- `POST /api/stripe/create-checkout-session`
- Firebase Firestore updates
- Proper error responses for missing keys

#### 3. **Error Handling**

Test error scenarios:
- Invalid tier names
- Network failures
- Missing authentication
- Invalid Stripe keys

### Browser Compatibility

**Tested and working:**
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

**Key Features:**
- ES6 modules support
- Fetch API
- Local Storage
- Firebase SDK compatibility

### Performance Verification

**Metrics to check:**
- Stripe SDK lazy loading: Only loads when needed
- Component memoization: No unnecessary re-renders
- Bundle size: Stripe SDK properly tree-shaken
- Network requests: Batched Firebase operations

**Lighthouse scores maintained:**
- Performance: >90
- Accessibility: >95
- Best Practices: >90
- SEO: >90

### Security Testing

**Verify:**
- Stripe public key exposed (expected)
- Stripe secret key NOT exposed
- Firebase auth tokens properly managed
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- CORS properly configured

### Production Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Replace test Stripe keys with production keys
- [ ] Configure Stripe webhook endpoints
- [ ] Set up proper domain verification
- [ ] Enable webhook signature verification
- [ ] Configure rate limiting
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Test with real payment methods
- [ ] Verify tax calculation (if applicable)
- [ ] Configure subscription analytics

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### **Error: "Stripe public key is required"**
- Check `.env` file for `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- Restart dev server after adding keys
- Verify key format starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`

#### **Error: "Module events has been externalized"**
- Fixed in implementation with browser-compatible EventEmitter
- Should not occur in current version

#### **Error: "Failed to create checkout session"**
- Check backend logs for detailed error
- Verify Stripe secret key configuration
- Check Stripe API connectivity

#### **Checkout redirects to blank page**
- Verify success/cancel URLs are accessible
- Check route configuration in App.tsx
- Confirm session_id parameter handling

### Analytics and Monitoring

**Key metrics to track:**
- Upgrade conversion rates
- Checkout abandonment
- Payment success/failure rates
- User subscription lifecycle
- Feature usage by tier

**Recommended tools:**
- Stripe Dashboard for payment analytics
- Firebase Analytics for user behavior
- Google Analytics for conversion tracking
- Sentry for error monitoring
