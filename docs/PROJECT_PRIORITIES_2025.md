## ü§ñ Grok Prompt Additions (Creative / Ideation Only)

Use these prompts with Grok for first-pass creative/content generation on non-complete initiatives. Keep outputs deterministic (request JSON where noted) for easier refinement.

| Task ID | Prompt |
|---------|--------|
| EXP-002 | (Completed) Upgrade modal copy variants JSON delivered (`docs/data/upgrade_modal_variants.json`). |
| COLLAB-050 | (Completed) Real-time collaborative chart sharing specification delivered. |
| SOCIAL-060 | Outline phased marketplace roadmap: MVP, Growth, Community. For each phase provide: features[], userStories[], moderationControls[], riskMitigations[], successMetrics[]. Output both a markdown summary table and JSON phases[]. |
| AI-070 | Propose layered AI interpretation roadmap: baseline templated -> adaptive contextual -> advanced reinforcement. For each layer list capabilities[], requiredDataSignals[], evaluationMetrics[] (engagement proxy, interpretation quality heuristic, retention lift), risks[], guardrails[]. Output markdown comparative table + JSON roadmap[]. |

Guidelines: 1) Prefer concise structured outputs 2) Flag any assumptions clearly 3) Avoid speculative implementation details outside scope.
