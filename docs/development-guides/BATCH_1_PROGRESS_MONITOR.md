# Batch 1 Progress Monitoring Report
**Generated**: August 19, 2025  
**Branch**: lint-cleanup-batch-1-claude35  
**Status**: In Progress (Monitoring Mode)

## Current Working Status
- **Active Instance**: Other instance working on batch 1 files
- **Coordination Mode**: Monitoring and documentation only
- **Modified Files**: apps/astro/src/features/ChartWheel.tsx

## Last Known Error Counts (from ESLint verification)
- **BirthDataContext.tsx**: ~10 errors (strict boolean expressions, unsafe assignments)
- **ChartWheel.tsx**: ~36 errors (unsafe assignments, missing types, unused vars)  
- **ChartWheelInteractive.tsx**: ~75 errors (unused imports, unsafe assignments, missing React)
- **Total**: 121 errors remaining

## Key Error Categories Still Being Addressed
1. **Type Safety Issues**
   - Unsafe assignments from `any` types
   - Unsafe member access on `any` values
   - Missing explicit type annotations

2. **Strict Boolean Expression Violations**
   - Nullable string/boolean checks need explicit handling
   - Need nullish coalescing operators (`??`) instead of logical or (`||`)

3. **Code Quality Issues**
   - Unused imports and variables
   - Missing return type annotations
   - Floating promises need proper handling

## Coordination Notes
- **Avoiding conflicts**: No direct file modifications during parallel work
- **Monitoring approach**: Regular status checks and documentation updates
- **Integration readiness**: Will verify completion before any integration steps

## Next Verification Points
- [ ] Monitor ChartWheel.tsx completion
- [ ] Verify BirthDataContext.tsx fixes
- [ ] Check ChartWheelInteractive.tsx progress
- [ ] Run final ESLint verification on all batch 1 files
- [ ] Update completion status when error count reaches 0
