- [ ] Push notifications for daily insights
- [ ] Widget support (iOS/Android)
- [ ] Apple Watch / WearOS integration
- [ ] Location-based timezone detection
- [ ] Camera integration for profile pictures
- [ ] Haptic feedback for interactions

## Phase 6: Offline Support & Performance

- [ ] Offline chart storage
- [ ] Background sync when online
- [ ] Image caching for charts
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Memory management for large datasets
- [ ] Progressive loading for large charts

## Phase 7: App Store Deployment

- [ ] App icons and splash screens
- [ ] App store metadata and screenshots
- [ ] Privacy policy and terms of service
- [ ] TestFlight/Play Console beta testing
- [ ] App store review and submission
- [ ] Analytics and crash reporting

## Component Migration Strategy

### High Priority Components to Migrate

1. **ChartDisplay** - SVG-based chart rendering
2. **BirthDataInput** - Form for user birth information
3. **FrequencyPlayer** - Audio playback for healing frequencies
4. **UserProfile** - Account management and settings
5. **NotificationManager** - Push notifications and alerts

### Medium Priority Components

1. **SynastryAnalysis** - Relationship compatibility charts
2. **TransitCalculator** - Current planetary transits
3. **ChartLibrary** - Saved charts management
4. **InterpretationDisplay** - AI-generated insights
5. **SubscriptionManager** - Premium features management

### Mobile-Specific Components to Build

1. **BiometricAuth** - Fingerprint/Face ID authentication
2. **LocationSelector** - GPS-based location picker
3. **AudioSession** - Background audio management
4. **OfflineSync** - Data synchronization
5. **PushNotifications** - Mobile notifications

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization

- Use React Native performance best practices
- Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- Optimize SVG rendering for charts
- Manage memory usage for audio playback
- Use appropriate caching strategies

### Platform-Specific Features

- iOS: Face ID, Apple Watch, Siri Shortcuts
- Android: Fingerprint, Android Auto, Widgets
- Cross-platform: Push notifications, background sync

### Data Management

- AsyncStorage for local data persistence
- Secure storage for authentication tokens
- Offline-first approach for core features
- Sync conflicts resolution

## Development Timeline Estimate

When ready to proceed:

- **Phase 2 (Auth)**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 3 (Astrology)**: 3-4 weeks  
- **Phase 4 (HealWave)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 5 (Mobile Features)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 6 (Offline)**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 7 (Deployment)**: 1 week

**Total Estimated Timeline**: 10-15 weeks for full mobile app

## Next Steps When Ready

1. **Start Development Server**:

   ```bash
   cd apps/mobile
   pnpm run dev
   ```

2. **Test on Device**: Install Expo Go and scan QR code

3. **Begin with Authentication**: Integrate Firebase auth first

4. **Migrate Core Components**: Start with most-used features

5. **Iterate and Test**: Regular testing on both iOS and Android

The foundation is solid and ready for development whenever you want to proceed with mobile features!
