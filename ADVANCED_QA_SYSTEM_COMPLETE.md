```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Quality Scoring Algorithm**
```typescript
// Multi-dimensional quality assessment
const qualityScore = (performance + accessibility + reliability) / 3;

// Performance scoring based on render times
const performanceScore = renderTime <= 16 ? 100 : 
                        renderTime <= 32 ? 80 : 60;

// Accessibility scoring based on ARIA compliance
const accessibilityScore = hasARIA ? 90 : 70;

// Reliability scoring based on test coverage
const reliabilityScore = hasVariants && hasInteractions ? 90 : 80;
```

### **Component Test Configuration**
```typescript
// Automated test generation for common patterns
export const createButtonTestConfig = (component) => ({
  name: 'Button',
  variants: ['Primary', 'Secondary', 'Disabled', 'Loading'],
  accessibility: { requiredRoles: ['button'], keyboardNavigation: true },
  performance: { maxRenderTime: 16 },
  interactions: ['Click', 'Keyboard Enter']
});
```

### **Quality Gates and Thresholds**
```typescript
// Project-level quality requirements
const QUALITY_THRESHOLDS = {
  minimumScore: 70,        // Component quality threshold
  performanceBudget: 32,   // Maximum render time (ms)
  accessibilityLevel: 90,  // ARIA compliance percentage
  coverageMinimum: 80      // Test coverage requirement
};
```
