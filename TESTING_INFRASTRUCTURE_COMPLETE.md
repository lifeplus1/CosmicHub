- **Build Time**: Maintains sub-2-second build performance

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### Environment-Specific Settings

```typescript
// Development Runner
const devRunner = createDevelopmentRunner({
  coverage: { threshold: 70 },
  performance: { maxRenderTime: 32 },
  accessibility: { level: 'AA' }
});

// CI Runner
const ciRunner = createCIRunner({
  coverage: { threshold: 80 },
  performance: { maxRenderTime: 16 },
  reports: { uploadResults: true }
});

// Production Runner
const prodRunner = createProductionRunner({
  coverage: { threshold: 90 },
  accessibility: { level: 'AAA' },
  performance: { maxRenderTime: 10 }
});
```

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Component-level testing with mocks
2. **Integration Tests**: Multi-component workflow testing
3. **Performance Tests**: Render time and memory validation
4. **Accessibility Tests**: ARIA and WCAG compliance
